# Exercises bin/compute-next-tag.sh against throwaway git repositories.

# Usage: bin/test-compute-next-tag.sh
#
# Every scenario creates a repository in a temporary directory, gives it role
# files and a release history, and then replays a series of merges through the
# real script, tagging as it goes just like the autotag workflow does. This
# repository is never touched and no network access is needed.
